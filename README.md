The initial experiments were a part of an assignment given from TCS ILP Innovations' Lab. Later as my appetite for the wonderful field of machine learning increased, I decided to give it another try and try out the new libraries. 

It includes benchmarking experiments on the [Adult Data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) using libraries like [`fastai`](docs.fast.ai), [`h2o`](http://docs.h2o.ai) and [`interpret`](https://github.com/Microsoft/interpret).

_But the real objective was to show how easy it is to interpret blackbox machine learning model with `interpret`. I think the library really stands its name_ :)
